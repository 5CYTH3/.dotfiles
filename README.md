# Dotfiles

## Overview
Here are my dotfiles for my Arch config (daily-driver). I use `pacdef` as declarative package manager to handle all of my packages.
To get the bare minimum packages needed in the distro, I use `archinstall` declarative-style config.
> [!WARNING]
> The archinstall script has not been fully reviewed. Do not use while this message is present.
